> A Minecraft mod all about storage.

Stockpile is powered by the [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) modloader and supports Minecraft 1.14. Versions below 0.4.0
ran on the Rift modloader for 1.13.

It depends on the Fabric API and Fabric's [Scala language module](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-language-scala).
