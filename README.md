> A Minecraft mod all about storage.

## Releases

Stable releases of Stockpile, built from the `master` branch, are available on
[CurseForge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/stockpile/files).

Versioned releases are also automatically pushed to GitHub Releases, however these may have remapping issues (i.e.
errors about classes not being found). Before opening an issue please make sure that you've tried the CurseForge
version.
