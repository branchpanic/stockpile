  // Hello! This design choice may seem a bit questionable, so here's some context as to why this exists.
  // Fabric-based Stockpile versions <= 0.4.6 depended on a serialization library I made, Cereal, that took care of
  // serializing fields automatically and bundled them up into a single compound. Looking at tags for these earlier
  // versions might shed some light on how this was used.
  //
  // I've since removed Cereal as a number of reasons, but to maintain compatibility, this PersistentData pattern
  // is needed. It will be removed following a breaking change.
  //
  // I've also learned my lesson about trying to make things simpler than they should be...
